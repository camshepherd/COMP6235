# Traffic Predictor

An Analysis into using Weather Data to Predict Volume and Makeup of Traffic in the UK

## Getting Started

The website is cross-platform, except for the convertbng library which does not work on 64-bit Windows. We recommend that WSL is used for running the 64-bit web server on Windows. The web server will take about 10-15 minutes to boot up due to the size of the data files to load into memory.
### Libraries

* Python3 with:
    * pandas
    * SciPy
    * NumPy
    * convertbng

### Installing

You need to have the full data files from MET Office/CEDA and the Highways Agency.
